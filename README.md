# About this repository

This repository houses the unminified code, feature tests and other stuff we worked with during the creation of this demo. 
_(Don't worry; The repository will be cleaned up a little bit during the coming next few days...)_

# Description

Use your mouse to place elements (and the scrollwheel to change the selected element).
Can you find all of the hidden reactions?

Featuring:

- A full-fledged two-dimensional chemistry sandbox
- Many different kinds of Solids, Liquids, Gases, with interesting and complex reactions between them. In total:
- 11 placeable elements,
- And at least as many hidden elements, (How many? you'll have to find out yourself!)
- In total, more than fifty different reactions that could take place.

Can you find:
- What happens when powder gets wet?
- The two different kinds of gas?
- How you can destroy a wall?
- The all-consuming VIRUS?
- The Magic Powder?
- Ice?

Unleash your inner alchemist!
Are you able to build a perpetually moving reaction?
Are you able to find the magic powder?

Spoiling more about what elements react in which ways would ruin half the fun,
so we'll refrain from doing so.
(if you _really_ need to know, look through the unminified source code).

Magic Powder is inspired by other Falling Sand-games like World of Sand, Powder Game and The Powder Toy, but fits in one kilobyte and has some unique features.

Built with lots of einthausiasm and love by Michiel de Jong and Wiebe-Marten Wijnja
